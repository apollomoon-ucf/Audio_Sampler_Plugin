# Vibe Music Productions - Audio Sampler Plugin
Summer Project by Brian Moon

For my second summer project, I will be building an audio plugin prototype for Vibe Music Productions, using C++ and the JUCE audio framework. Vibe is a professional recording studio and music production facility located in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.
