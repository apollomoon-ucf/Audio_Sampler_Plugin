# Vibe Music Productions - Audio Sampler Plugin
Summer Project by Brian Moon


# Introduction
For one of my 2021 summer projects, I will be building an audio plugin prototype for Vibe Music Productions. 
Vibe is a professional recording studio and music production facility located in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. 

Recording Studio Website: https://www.vibemusicproductions.com/

The development process of the plugin will be documented in this readme.


# Technology and Setup
The recording studio will need the plugin to be compatible with Native Instrument's Maschine 2 running on Windows 10. 
C++ and the JUCE audio framework will be used to develop the plugin.

# Layout
To visualize a rough layout of the plugin, I created a sketch using https://sketch.io/sketchpad/.
Note: This visualization is not meant to represent the final design of the user interface. Once plugin functionality is established, I will work on making it aesthetically pleasing.
